 I actually wanted to learn using sql in pyhton so that i can store my data's in table so for that i work on this very small pyhton with sqlite3 project but it is full of content .
 WHAT DOES IT DO ?
connect with the database all performing the sql commands using cursor 
1. ADD USER INTO THE TABLE 
2. SEARCH FOR THE USER (THAT EXIST IN TABLE) .
3. DELETE USER FROM THE TABLE 
4. IT'S HELP US TO SEE THE TABLE 
WHAT I LEARNED ?
1. importing sqlite3 in pyhton 
2. connecting to database 
3. using cursor function i.e (cursor.execute(),cursor.executescript(),cursor.rowcount())
4. learned about how to insert the values in table in real-time , taking input from the user 
5. created function for the clarity and readablity 
what improvements can be made ?
I know , I don't uses the many main command command and concept of sql yet but as I mentioned this is a small project . so may be in further project where I will be using more concept of sql . 

thank you for checking it out
