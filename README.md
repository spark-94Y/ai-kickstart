I actually wanted to learn using SQL in Python so that I can store my data in tables.  
For that, I worked on this very small Python project with SQLite3 â€” but it is full of content.

## WHAT DOES IT DO?

This project connects to a database and performs all the SQL commands using a cursor:

1. **Add user into the table**
2. **Search for the user** (that exists in the table)
3. **Delete user from the table**
4. **Display all users in the table**

## WHAT I LEARNED

1. Importing `sqlite3` in Python  
2. Connecting to a database  
3. Using cursor functions: `cursor.execute()`, `cursor.executescript()`, `cursor.rowcount()`  
4. How to insert values into a table in real-time, taking input from the user  
5. Creating functions for clarity and readability

## WHAT IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE MADE?

I know I haven't used many advanced SQL commands or concepts yet,  
but as I mentioned, this is a small project.  
In future projects, I plan to explore and use more SQL concepts.
